QRScanner based on apache licensed code from natiginfo:
https://github.com/natiginfo/QRScannerCameraX

 Modifications including:
 - a webview created with QR codes containing web pages (such as menus at restaraunts)
 - Refactored src to com.sampleqrapp.qrscanner
 - Removed unit tests
 - SDK version 30 instead of 28
 - Uses gradle 6.11

I'd like to put this under the GNU license, as I think all software I produce should be free -- but I respect natiginfo's Apache license.
Please enjoy and thank natiginfo.

Enjoy!
